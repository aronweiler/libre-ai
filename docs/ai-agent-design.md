# AI Agent Design for LibreOffice Writer Extension

## Purpose
This document details the design for an agentic architecture enabling robust, reliable, and user-friendly AI-powered editing in LibreOffice Writer. The design separates user interaction (primary/orchestrator AI) from document editing execution (tool-calling agent), ensuring safe, iterative, and context-aware document manipulation.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

### Components
- **Primary Orchestrator AI**: Handles all user interaction, conversation history, intent understanding, and task planning.
- **Tool-Calling Agent**: Receives actionable task specifications, performs document edits using a curated Python toolset, and manages retries and error handling internally.

### Key Design Goals
- Decouple user-facing logic from low-level document editing
- Hide tool-calling complexity and retries from the user and orchestrator
- Ensure safe, reliable, and maintainable document edits
- Provide clear communication and feedback between components

---

## 2. Task Handoff and Context Passing

### Task Specification Structure
The orchestrator converts user requests into a structured, self-contained task specification. This includes:
- **task_id**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **description**: Clear, actionable instruction (e.g., "Make the first paragraph bold and insert a bulleted list of skills below the header.")
- **document_context**: Only the relevant portion of the document (text snippets, structure, positions, styles, etc.)
- **constraints**: Limits or preferences (e.g., formatting style, max retries)
- **rationale** (optional): Clarifies user intent if needed

#### Example
```json
{
  "task_id": "12345",
  "description": "Update the resume header to be bold, show the user's name, and add a bulleted list of skills below.",
  "document_context": {
    "header_position": 0,
    "header_text": "Jane Doe",
    "skills": ["Python", "LibreOffice", "AI Integration"]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "max_retries": 3,
    "style": "professional"
  },
  "rationale": "The user wants the header to stand out and skills to be clearly listed."
}
```

### Context Extraction
The orchestrator (or a helper) extracts and summarizes only the relevant document context for the task:
- Section, paragraph, or range to be edited
- Current state (text, formatting, styles)
- Metadata as needed

---

## 3. Tool-Calling Agent Interface

The agent exposes a simple API:
```python
def perform_edit_task(task_spec: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Receives a task specification, performs the requested edits (with retries if needed),
    and returns a result dict with status, any errors, and a summary of changes.
    """
```

### Agent Responsibilities
- Parse and understand the task specification
- Use the provided document context and constraints
- Call the appropriate Python tool functions to perform edits
- Handle errors and retry up to the specified limit
- Summarize changes and outcomes
- Return a structured result

### Result/Feedback Structure
The agent returns:
- **status**: success/failure
- **summary**: description of changes made
- **errors**: any errors encountered
- **suggestions**: next steps if failed
- **log** (optional): tool calls and retry attempts

#### Example Result
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Header updated to bold, name inserted, skills list added.",
  "errors": [],
  "log": [
    "Applied bold to header.",
    "Inserted name.",
    "Added bulleted list."
  ]
}
```

---

## 4. Retry and Error Handling Logic
- The agent attempts the task using the toolset.
- If an error occurs, the agent analyzes the error, adapts its approach, and retries (up to `max_retries`).
- If all retries fail, the agent returns a detailed error and suggestions for next steps.
- The orchestrator is not involved in retries—this complexity is encapsulated within the agent.

---

## 5. Optional Enhancements

### A. Task Chaining
- If a task fails, the agent can suggest a revised task spec for the orchestrator to review or approve.
- Enables collaborative problem-solving between orchestrator and agent.

### B. Logging
- The agent maintains a detailed log of tool calls, parameters, results, and retry attempts.
- Useful for debugging, auditing, and improving tool reliability.

### C. Feedback Loop
- If retries are exhausted, the agent provides a clear error message and suggestions for next steps.
- The orchestrator can then clarify with the user or adjust the task spec.

### D. Dynamic Toolset Expansion
- The agent can report on missing capabilities or suggest new tools to add, based on failed or repeated user requests.

## 6. Summary Table

| Component        | Receives                | Sends to Agent         | Agent Receives        | Agent Returns         |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Orchestrator     | User conversation      | Task spec + context    | Task spec, context    | Result dict          |
| Tool-Calling Agent | Task spec + context   | (Tool calls, retries)  | -                     | Success/failure, summary, errors, log |

---

## 7. Implementation Guidance
- **Keep task specs atomic and self-contained**—avoid passing unnecessary context.
- **Extract only relevant document state**—minimize data transfer and maximize agent focus.
- **Design tool functions to be robust and composable**—make it easy for the agent to sequence actions.
- **Iterate on agent retry and error handling logic**—log failures and refine strategies over time.
- **Regularly review agent logs**—identify common failure modes and opportunities for toolset expansion.

This design ensures a modular, maintainable, and user-friendly AI-powered editing experience in LibreOffice Writer, with robust error handling and clear separation of concerns between user interaction and document manipulation.
