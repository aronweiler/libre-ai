# LibreOffice Writer AI Extension: Design Overview

## Purpose
This extension enables users to interact with an AI assistant via a sidebar panel in LibreOffice Writer. The AI assistant can understand natural language instructions and make meaningful, context-aware edits to the document—such as formatting, inserting content, or restructuring text—by leveraging a curated set of safe, well-defined tool functions implemented in Python.

## Key Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python (for all AI logic, tool functions, and UNO API interactions)
- **LibreOffice UNO API:** For document manipulation
- **Sidebar UI:** Integrated into LibreOffice Writer for user interaction
- **AI Model:** Orchestrates user requests and tool usage (can interface with external AI APIs such as OpenAI)

## Architectural Approach

### 1. Agentic Architecture
- **Primary Orchestrator AI:**
  - Acts as the main interface for the user.
  - Interprets user instructions and breaks them down into actionable steps.
  - Coordinates the workflow and delegates tasks to specialized agents.

- **Specialized Tool-Calling Agents:**
  - Responsible for executing specific document manipulation tasks using the curated Python toolset.
  - Can iterate on their assigned tasks, handling errors or refining results as needed.

- **Iterative Task Handling:**
  - Recognizes that document manipulation can be error-prone.
  - Allows tool-calling agents to retry, refine, or repeat actions under the supervision of the orchestrator until the desired outcome is achieved.

### 2. Curated Toolset
- A comprehensive, well-documented set of Python functions for:
  - Applying formatting and styles
  - Inserting and editing text, lists, tables, images, etc.
  - Navigating and analyzing document structure
  - Other common editing and formatting tasks
- The AI agents interact with the document exclusively through this toolset, ensuring safety, reliability, and maintainability.

## User Workflow
1. **User enters a request** in the sidebar panel (e.g., "Update my resume so that the header is in bold, shows my name, and then has a list of my skills in bullet points below it").
2. **Primary Orchestrator AI** interprets the request and plans the necessary steps.
3. **Tool-Calling Agents** execute the required actions using the Python toolset, iterating as needed to achieve the desired result.
4. **Document is updated** in real time, with changes reflected in LibreOffice Writer.

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Safety:** Restricts document manipulation to a controlled set of Python functions.
- **Reliability:** Iterative error handling and refinement ensure high-quality results.
- **Flexibility:** The agentic design allows for complex, multi-step operations and easy future expansion.
- **User Experience:** Natural language interface and real-time feedback make advanced editing accessible to all users.
