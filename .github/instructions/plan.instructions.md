# LibreOffice AI Extension Implementation Plan

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for implementing the LibreOffice Writer AI extension, referencing all relevant design documents. Follow each section in order for a smooth development process.

---

## 1. Review the Overall Design

Start by understanding the high-level architecture, goals, and agentic approach for the extension.
- **Reference:** [docs/design-overview.md](./design-overview.md)

---

## 2. Understand the Agentic Architecture

Familiarize yourself with the agentic separation between the user-facing orchestrator and the tool-calling agent, including task handoff, error handling, and optional enhancements.
- **Reference:** [docs/ai-agent-design.md](./ai-agent-design.md)

---

## 3. Plan the LLM Provider Plugin System

Learn how to support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama) using LangChain, and how to implement a provider abstraction layer and configuration UI.
- **Reference:** [docs/llm-provider-design.md](./llm-provider-design.md)

---

## 4. Design and Build the Conversation UI

Follow the UI design for a user-friendly, programmatically constructed sidebar conversation interface. Ensure all required controls and interactions are implemented.
- **Reference:** [docs/ui-design.md](./ui-design.md)

---

## 5. Implement the Toolset for Document Editing

Develop the comprehensive set of Python functions that the AI agent will use to manipulate the Writer document. Ensure each function is robust, atomic, and cross-platform.
- **Reference:** [docs/proposed-tools.md](docs/proposed-tools.md)

---

## 6. Implement the Agentic Logic

- Build the primary orchestrator AI to interpret user requests, extract relevant document context, and create structured task specifications.
- Build the tool-calling agent to receive task specs, perform edits using the toolset, handle retries, and return results.
- Implement logging, error handling, and optional enhancements as described.
- **Reference:** [docs/ai-agent-design.md](./ai-agent-design.md)

---

## 7. Integrate LLM Providers via LangChain

- Implement provider classes for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama, all inheriting from the LangChain base class.
- Implement runtime configuration loading and provider instantiation.
- Ensure secure handling of API keys and parameters.
- **Reference:** [docs/llm-provider-design.md](./llm-provider-design.md)

---

## 8. Build the Configuration and Conversation UI

- Programmatically construct the sidebar UI using the UNO API, following the design document.
- Implement the configuration dialog for provider selection and parameter entry.
- Ensure accessibility, error handling, and a smooth user experience.
- **Reference:** [docs/ui-design.md](./ui-design.md)

---

## 9. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Use Pythonâ€™s cross-platform libraries and the UNO API for all file, path, and UI operations.
- Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Store configuration and user data in platform-appropriate locations.
- **Review:** Cross-platform considerations in the main documentation and design documents.

---

## 10. Testing and Packaging

- Test all features and workflows on all supported platforms.
- Package the extension as a `.oxt` file for distribution.
- Document installation and configuration steps for users on each platform.

---

## 11. Documentation and User Support

- Provide clear user documentation for setup, provider configuration, and troubleshooting.
- Reference all design documents for future maintenance and enhancements.

---

## 12. Maintenance and Future Enhancements

- Regularly review logs and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
- Expand the toolset and provider support as needed.
- Keep documentation and dependencies up to date.

---

By following this implementation plan and referencing the detailed design documents, you will be able to build, test, and maintain a robust, user-friendly, and cross-platform AI-powered extension for LibreOffice Writer.
